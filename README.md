The object of Minesweeper is to expose all the open areas on the board without hitting an bombs.

## How to play

The numbers on the board represent how many bombs are adjacent to a square. 
For example, if a square has a "3" on it, then there are 3 bombs next to that square. The bombs could be above, below, right left, or diagonal to the square. Avoid all the bombs and expose all the empty spaces to win Minesweeper. 

Tip: Use the numbers to determine where you know a bomb is. 

Tip: You can right click a square with the mouse to place a flag where you think a bomb is. This allows you to avoid that spot.
